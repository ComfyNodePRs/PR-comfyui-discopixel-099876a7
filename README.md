# ComfyUI Geometry Nodes

A small collection of custom nodes for use with [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI), for geometry calculations

## üîå Available Nodes

#### 1. Mask to Centroid

Takes a mask as input, and calculates the centroid.
Useful to find the center of a shape in the mask.
This assumes there is only one shape, and that the shape is comprised of white pixels over a black background.

#### 2. Mask to Eigenvector

Takes a mask as input, and calculates the 2D eigenvector.
Useful to find the rotation and scaling of a shape in the mask.
This assumes there is only one shape, and that the shape is comprised of white pixels over a black background.
Eigenvector is calculated assuming that an "identity" shape is vertically oriented oval.
